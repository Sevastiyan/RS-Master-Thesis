## Abstract

Re:Voir is an experimental film distribution company that wants to create subscription-based video streaming service. In this project, we find out what characterizes experimental films is and how they can be divided into categories. We explore state of the art literature about recommendation systems and analyse state of the art services such as Netflix and Youtube, and create a custom recommendation system tailored to experimental film. This project creates a pattern for implementation based on previous researchers. By trying to implement some of the generalised systems in the most adequate way. The main goal is to help Re:voir develop a recommender system corresponding to the research in this project. As Re:voir is a niche company the best way to achieve the goal is to follow the approach of the evolution of the internet from the ground up. This way they will acquire data the most efficient way possible and further build their data analysis. Lastly, we create a user interface design, based on current trends in this field.

## This repository: 

The repository contains the Python Notebook `notebook.ipynb` used for development. It contains the analysis and exploration a collaborative filtering algorithms using Machine Learning. The implementation of the algorithm is then shipped to Re:Voir who choses what to do with the developped algorithm.
